## Objective
Learn to implement and handle nested dynamic routes in a React application. Create a blog application where blog posts, stored in a JSON file, are displayed dynamically based on the URL.

## Setup

1. **Create an 'Exercises' Directory** (If not already done):
   - If you haven't already, create a main directory on your local machine to house all your exercises. You can do this using `mkdir Exercises`.

2. **Fork the Repository**:
   - Navigate to the GitHub repository for this exercise at `03-24-nested-dynamic-routes`.
   - Click on the 'Fork' button to create a fork of the repository.

3. **Clone Your Forked Repository**:
   - Open your terminal.
   - Navigate to your `Exercises` directory using `cd path/to/Exercises`.
   - Run `git clone <your-forked-repo-url>` to clone the repository to your machine.
   - This will create a new directory named `03-24-nested-dynamic-routes` under `Exercises`.

4. **Initial Setup**:
   - The repository already includes the skeleton code generated by Create React App, along with a `data` folder in the `src` directory containing the `blog.json` file.
   - Navigate to the exercise directory: `cd 03-24-nested-dynamic-routes`.
   - Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
   - Start the development server with `npm start`.

## `blog.json` Structure
The `blog.json` file in the `data` folder will have the following structure:

```json
{
  "posts": {
    "1": {
      "title": "First Blog Post",
      "summary": "A brief summary of the first post.",
      "content": "Full content of the first blog post...",
      "author": "Author Name",
      "date": "2023-01-01",
      "tags": ["React", "JavaScript"]
    },
    "2": {
      "title": "Second Blog Post",
      "summary": "A brief summary of the second post.",
      "content": "Full content of the second blog post...",
      "author": "Another Author",
      "date": "2023-01-02",
      "tags": ["Web Development", "HTML"]
    },
    // ... more posts
  }
}
```

Each blog post is an object containing properties like `title`, `summary`, `content`, `author`, `date`, and `tags`.

## Exercise Instructions

1. **Create a Basic Blog Layout**:
   - Develop a `Blog` component that serves as the main layout for your blog application. Include areas for a list of posts and for displaying a selected post in detail.

2. **Build the Post List Component**:
   - Implement a `PostList` component that lists blog posts from the `blog.json` file. Display each post's title and summary, and make the titles clickable links.

3. **Implement Nested Dynamic Routes for Blog Posts**:
   - Within the `Blog` component, set up nested routes. The base route `/blog` should display the `PostList`.
   - Create dynamic routes like `/blog/:postId` that render a `PostDetail` component within the `Blog` layout, showing the full content of the post based on the `postId` from the URL.

4. **Design the PostDetail Component**:
   - The `PostDetail` component should retrieve and display detailed information of the blog post including title, full content, author, date of posting, and tags.
   - Ensure the layout effectively presents these different aspects of a blog post.

5. **Testing Nested Routes**:
   - Verify that navigating to `/blog` displays the list of posts with their summaries.
   - Ensure that clicking a post's title navigates to the detailed view of that post with all its content displayed properly.

## Submission

1. **Commit Your Changes**:
   - After completing the exercise, ensure all your changes are saved.
   - Run `git add .` to stage your changes.
   - Run `git commit -m "Completed Nested Dynamic Routes exercise"` to commit your changes.

2. **Push to Your Fork**:
   - Run `git push` to push your commits to your forked repository on GitHub.

3. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
   - Click on 'Pull Request' to create a new pull request to the original repository.
   - Ensure the pull request details are filled out, explaining the changes you made.
